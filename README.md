this is my personal website, it emulates a cmd. i used typed.js for the typing animation, which is a very easy to use javascript lib (https://github.com/mattboldt/typed.js/)

if you want to add this to your website through cdn make sure to include <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/typed.js@2.0.11"> </script>
